# Student Loan Recommendation System

## Overview
The Student Loan Recommendation System is designed to assist students in finding the best loan options based on their personal and financial profiles. Using machine learning and neural networks, the system predicts the likelihood of successful loan repayment and provides tailored loan recommendations.

## Project Structure
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing:
   * This step involves gathering data from various sources, cleaning it, and preparing it for modeling. The data is scaled and split into training and testing sets to ensure the model's robustness. 
2. Model Building & Training:
   * A neural network is constructed using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is then trained on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and make predictions.
3. Model Evaluation & Prediction:
   * The trained model's performance is evaluated using test data. This step includes generating metrics such as accuracy and loss, and producing a classification report.
4. Recommendation System:
   * Utilizing the trained model, the system provides loan recommendations based on the input student profiles. 

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with several packages. Follow these steps to set up the environment: 
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/jdanielle12/neural-network-challenge-1
cd neural-network-challenge-1`
2. Create a virtual environment:
`python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data Requirements
To build a robust student loan recommendation system, the following data is necessary:
* **Student Demographics**: Age, gender, location.
* **Educational Background**: Current institution, degree program, GPA, year of study.
* **Financial Information**: Income, credit score, existing loans.
* **Loan Preferences**: Loan amount, repayment term, interest rate, deferment options.
* **Historical Data**: Past loan repayment history, employment prospects.

This data is relevant as it provides a comprehensive view of the student's financial status and loan preferences, enabling the system to make accurate recommendations.

## Filtering Method
The recommendation system uses content-based filtering. This approach matches the attributes of students with loan options. Content-based filtering is suitable here because it leverages the detailed profiles and loan features to provide personalized recommendations.

## Real-World Challenges
1. Data Privacy and Security:
* Handling sensitive information requires strict compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and FERPA.
* Implementing robust encryption methods and access controls is essential to protect student data.
  
2. Data Quality and Completeness:
* Incomplete or inaccurate data can lead to poor recommendations.
* Ensuring data validation checks and encouraging complete and accurate information submission is crucial for reliable recommendations.

## Conclusion
The Student Loan Recommendation System demonstrates how machine learning and neural networks can be used to provide personalized loan recommendations. By focusing on data collection, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, the system addresses key challenges in recommending appropriate loan options for students.
